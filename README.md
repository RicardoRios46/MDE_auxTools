# MDE_auxTools (Beta)

MDE_auxTools contains some useful functions that help to implement B-tensor Encoding Sequences on a Bruker Scanner. The functions here are intended to use as connectors for other toolboxes developed by the DW-MRI scientific community to have a complete acquisition pipeline:

## Repositories used in the pipeline:
* [NOW](https://github.com/jsjol/NOW)
* [MCW sequences](http://osf.io/ngu4a/)
* [MD-dMRI](https://github.com/markus-nilsson/md-dmri)

## Requirements
*nowToSequence* needs that *NOW* toolbox is already on matlab path.

*brukerRawToImages* works with *pvmatlab* toolbox from Bruker. To get this toolbox you need to contact Bruker support.
